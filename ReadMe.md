# Module 4 HTML Assignment

## Overview
This project demonstrates foundational HTML skills covered in Module 4. It includes key components such as a navigation bar, a contact form with validation, a structured product table, and an image gallery.

## Features Implemented
- **Navigation Bar:** Semantic `<nav>` with an unordered list providing links to Home, About, and Contact pages.
- **Contact Form:** Accessible form with required fields (Name, Email, Message), including a radio button group for user feedback on how they found the site. Uses semantic elements and includes accessibility enhancements.
- **Product Table:** A well-structured table with headers showing product names, prices, and quantities, designed for clarity and accessibility.
- **Image Gallery:** Includes a placeholder image and a second image with rounded borders, styled with CSS for visual appeal.

## Code Quality & Accessibility
- Semantic HTML5 elements used throughout for better document structure.
- ARIA roles and attributes implemented for improved screen reader support.
- Responsive design considerations with the viewport meta tag.
- Visual enhancements applied through CSS for a modern, user-friendly interface.
- Form elements include appropriate labels, placeholders, and focus styles to improve usability.

## How to Run
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.
3. Test form validation and responsive layout by resizing the browser window.

## Additional Notes
- The form currently uses a placeholder action (`#`) and does not submit data to a backend.
- Styling is included directly within the HTML file for simplicity but can be separated into an external CSS file for larger projects.
